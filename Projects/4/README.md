# Introduction

This project provides notebooks and tutorials for creating  Convolutional Neural Network models for detecting COVID-19 in CT-Scans.

We will be using FastAI to create classifier implementations using [SARS-COV-2 Ct-Scan Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-dataset "SARS-COV-2 Ct-Scan Dataset"), a large dataset of CT scans for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) identification created by our collaborators, Plamenlancaster: [Professor Plamen Angelov](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lira/people/#d.en.397371) from [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/)/ Centre Director @ [Lira](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lira/), & his researcher, [Eduardo Soares PhD](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/about-us/people/eduardo-almeida-soares).

# DISCLAIMER

These projects should be used for research purposes only. The purpose of the projects are to show the potential of Artificial Intelligence for medical support systems such as diagnosis systems. Although the programs are fairly accurate and show good results both on paper and in real world testing, they are not meant to be an alternative to professional medical diagnosis. Salvatore Raieli is a bioinformatician researcher and PhD in Immunology, but does not work in medical diagnosis. Please use these systems responsibly.

&nbsp;

# Train

Assuming you have completed the installation guide, you can now begin training.

## Start Training

Navigate to the project root and open the choosen notebook.
